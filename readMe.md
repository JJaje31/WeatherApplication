# Weather app
This here is a basic weather app. You can search anywhere in the us. Sadly if you mispell your city or state the whole app crashes. This is my first app I built so I hope you enjoy it. As much as I did building it

## Usage
This app is run on localhost:5000.
All you have to do is cd into the server folder run a npm install and then run npm start.

## Features
Type in your city and state you want the weather for. There are two buttons on the bottom to see the temperture and conditions.
